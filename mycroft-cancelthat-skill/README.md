Dismisses Mycroft

## About
Just playing around with modifying an existing skill for Mycroft AI before I attempt writing my own. Please use <a href="https://github.com/ChanceNCounter/nevermind-skill" target="blank">ChanceNCounter's Skill</a> rather than my nonsense. 
<br />
OAllows you to dismiss Mycroft verbally, in case of accidental activation, or if you change your mind. By default, Mycroft will confirm
this action, but there is a setting to disable verbal feedback, accessible over the web interface.


## Examples
* "nevermind"
* "dismissed"
* "forget it"
* "go away"
