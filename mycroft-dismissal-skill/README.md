# Dismissal
Dismisses Mycroft - forked from <a href="https://github.com/ChanceNCounter/dismissal-skill">ChanceNCounter's skill</a> to customise my own commands.

## About
Allows you to dismiss Mycroft verbally, in case of accidental activation, or if you change your mind. By default, Mycroft will confirm this action, but there is a setting to disable verbal feedback, accessible over the web interface.


## Examples
* "nevermind"
* "dismissed"
* "forget it"
* "go away"
