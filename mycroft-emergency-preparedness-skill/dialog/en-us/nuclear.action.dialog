In case of a nuclear event or attack, it is important to remain calm . The first thing to do is to stay indoors and limit the amount of air coming in from outside. Close all windows and doors and attempt to seal any gaps as best as you can. Turn off any air exchangers and heat recovery units as well as any appliances. If you were outside at the time of the nuclear event, remove your clothes before entering the house and rinse your hair and body in the shower. Gather your emergency kit, remain indoors, and wait for any important instructions from authorities as these may include evacuation orders. If you want to know about how to prepare for a nuclear event, just ask me.
