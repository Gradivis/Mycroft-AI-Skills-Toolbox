In case of a tornado, don't panic. The first thing you should do is take shelter in your home - either in the basement or a room on the interior ground floor. It's important that you stay away from windows and rooms that have an exterior-facing wall. If you don't have a basement, take refuge under a heavy table or desk. Get as close to the ground as possible - protect your head and watch for flying debris. If you hear the tornado dying down, do not get up immediately - wait untill you are sure it has passed. Once the tornado has passed, be cautious when heading back outside - watch for debris and other hazards like downed power lines. If you want to know about how to prepare for a tornado, just ask me.
