During a wildfire, you should be prepared to evacuate at any time. Monitor local radio stations, and if you are told to evacuate, do so without wasting time. When outside, wrap a wet towel around your nose and mouth to aid breathing. When inside, keep all doors and windows closed, and remove flammable drapes or curtains that are near windows. Keep lights on to help you see in case smoke makes it difficult, and if there is sufficient water turn a sprinkler system on to protect the area around your home. If you would like to know how to prepare for a wildfire, just ask me.
